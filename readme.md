### Blogging site

The Tech Stack i used is NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDb(Mongoose), EJS(For dynamic rendering) , cloudinary(for multimedia handling)

I have already made a blogging site using express and mongodb, but that was just a college assignment and now I want to take this on another level. I would now be focusing on good visualization as well as more functionalities
