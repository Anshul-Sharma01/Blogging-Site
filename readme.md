### Blogging site

The Tech Stack i used is NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDb(Mongoose), cloudinary(for multimedia handling)

I have already made a blogging site using express and mongodb, but that was just a college assignment and now I want to take this on another level. I would now be focusing on good visualization as well as more functionalities


## Present status : 
Had implemented both userControllers as well as blogControllers and full backend is completed. Now just left with the FrontEnd part.
Technologies used in backend : NodeJs, ExpressJs, JWT, bcrypt, crypto, cookieParser, dotenv, nodemailer, cloudinary( for storage of multimedia as well as updation and deletion)
